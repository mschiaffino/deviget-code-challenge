# deviget-code-challenge

## Decisions taken

- Use AWS S3 to host the app.
- Postpone Reddit API integration: to avoid wasting scarce time, since an API response mock has been provided, the integration will be implemented only if time permits. Pagination will be implemented after API integration.
- Use element IO componentes dependecy to avoid wating time working on styling.
